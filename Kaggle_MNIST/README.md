# Kaggle MNIST — Simple Project

A small project of a basic classification model using the MNIST dataset, based on the Digit Recognizer challege (Kaggle).

## Contents
- main.py : main code for the model
- data.py : data loading and processing code
- data/ — place CSV files here (not included in repo)  

## Dataset
Download the dataset from Kaggle:
- Competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer
- Direct data link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data

Requirements:
- A Kaggle account is required

Expected files:
- `data/train.csv`
- `data/test.csv`

## What this project shows
- Simple data preprocessing (TODO)
- Training a baseline CNN with a few layers from scratch
- Evaluation (TODO : corss-validation)
- Generating a Kaggle submission file

## Notes
- Do not commit dataset files to version control.
- This repository is intended for learning and experimentation.
